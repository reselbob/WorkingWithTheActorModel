# Working With The Actor Model
This project demonstrates implementing a Shopping Cart use case for a fictitious company named Barry's Gourmet Peanuts.

There are two implementations of the Shopping Cart. One example implements the Shopping Cart in the Akka/Java framework. The other
example implements the Shopping Cart in Temporal. The Temporal implementation maps onto the workflow structure of the Akka/Java implementation.

The Akka/Java implementation is [here](./BarrysPeanutsAkkaFlat).

The Temporal implementation is [here](./BarrysPeanutsTemporalJava).
