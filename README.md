# Working With The Actor Model
This project demonstrates implementing a Shopping Cart use case for a fictitious company named Barry's Gourmet Peanuts.

There are two implementations of the Shopping Cart. One example implements the Shopping Cart in the [Akka/Java](https://akka.io/) framework. The other
example implements the Shopping Cart in [Temporal](https://docs.temporal.io/). The Temporal implementation maps onto the workflow structure of the Akka/Java implementation.

The Akka/Java implementation is [here](./BarrysPeanutsAkkaJava).

The Temporal implementation is [here](./BarrysPeanutsTemporalJava).
